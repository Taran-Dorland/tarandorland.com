            After her death in 1963, Decca, now known as Universal Music Group,
            released all of her unreleased work in a single album.

          Bell Should NOT be Allowed to Restrict or Block Websites (Part B):
        </h2>

        <p class="para-main">
          Bell and other “Internet Service Providers” should not be able to block or restrict access to anything on the internet, including websites.
          Some of the main reasons on why they should not be allowed include; Censorship, who gets to decide what people see can lead to a very dangerous society.
          The role of an “Internet Service Provider” is to provide access to the internet, not monitor and restrict it, doing this shouldn’t allow them to be considered an “internet service provider.”
          Finally, blocking and restricting websites will not stop the problem, and in the end, will only harm the average consumer.
          These reasons support that Bell and other ISP’s should not be allowed to dictate and control what the consumer sees, and should worry more about improving their own service to make the consumer actually want to buy their it.
        </p>

        <p class="para-main">
          The first and most important reason why restricting websites is bad is censorship. What group or organization gets to decide what the end users see?
          What does it cost to censor information? The internet service provider is there to provide access to the internet to the consumer, not dictate what they can and cannot see on the internet.
          Allowing groups such as governments and large corporations to censor information begins to form a dystopian society.
          Continuing to allow this type of censorship can lead to thought police where if someone begins to have a differing opinion or thoughts than the socially accepted one will be punished for it.
          Censorship can also lead to fake news or propaganda while censoring out opposing beliefs or facts making people believe that there is only one correct answer and anyone who disagrees will be punished.
          Therefore, censoring information online or anywhere is a bad idea.
        </p>

        <p class="para-main">
          The second reason why restricting websites is bad is that an Internet Service Provider’s job is to provide access to the internet.
          If an internet service provider is not providing access to the internet, should they be considered an internet service provider?
          Allowing ISP’s to monitor and restrict access to specific parts of the internet is very dangerous considering the companies providing the internet,
          usually also provide the content the user sees on the internet as well as on TV and through your mobile phone. What is to stop an ISP from restricting or blocking content from a competitor ISP?
          Restricting and blocking content helps form larger monopolies in the ISP/phone/cable industry and discourages competition, especially start-ups or companies with a much smaller budget.
          Allowing one company to have so much control over the content, the way people access your content and the prices each cost all while having the ability to choose what the consumer sees and doesn’t see is extremely harmful for the consumer
          and makes the large corporations untouchable. The only way this can be dealt with is if the government introduces new laws to protect the consumer against these kinds of practices.
        </p>

        <p class="para-main">
          The final reason why restricting websites is bad is that it will not stop the problem. Companies like Bell support blocking websites because they believe that certain websites, like torrent sites, damage their profits.
          They believe that people who download or stream the content that they provide is a lost sale, when in reality that person was never going to buy their content in the first place, usually because of price gouging or the inability to view that content legally.
          Instead of providing competitive pricing or a way to view the content that doesn’t suck or both, they attempt to block the ways people are getting the content. Although their blocking system doesn’t work.
          Anyone can download a VPN and access the blocked content, without having to worry about Bell or any other ISP following their every move.
          In the end, blocking websites or other content only hurts the average consumer who doesn’t know or care about downloaded content that was obtained illegally.
        </p>

        <p class="para-main">
          Overall Bell and other Internet Service Providers or any content distribution service should not be allowed to restrict or block information that they do not agree with.
          Reasons like Censorship, The Role of an ISP, and The Problem will not be Fixed support that the internet should not be restricted, blocked or censored by anyone including the government and large corporations.
          Instead, they must find a more consumer friendly solution that benefits all parties without damaging the integrity or credibility of information found online.
