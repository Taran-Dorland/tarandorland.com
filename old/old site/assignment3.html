          Both the Laser-Cutter knife and the Electricity-Infused Knife will make your cooking experience much easier and more fun! Both knives can be used for cutting vegetables, fruit, meat, and any other form of food! Cleaning both knives is easy and safe, and is also dishwasher friendly. When the Laser-edge and electricity-infusion is disabled,
          these knives offer an extra-sharp blade and stays sharp 7 times longer than other knives. The edges of both knives are made with a patented alloy which is twice as strong as titanium. Our patent-pending process bonds the alloy into a stainless-steel knife body. This process not only makes our knives more efficient and reliable,
          but also means that our knives will last forever. Our knives will revolutionize the knife industry and set a new gold standard for future knives.
        </p>

        <p class="para-main">
          The Laser-Cutter knife will retail for $195, and the Electricity-Infused knife will retail for $385, however if you pledge to back right now, you can get the Laser-Cutter knife for $150 and the Electricity-Infused knife for $325 or both for $445. Shipping will start early 2018 and all purchases will include lifetime warranty.
        </p>

        <p class="para-main">
          If we reach our goal of $250,000 then everyone who has purchased a tier above $350 will also receive a free Electricity-Infused pocket knife, which has similar capabilities to the Electricity-Infused knife, but in a smaller form. If we exceed our goal of $250,000 and reach $500,000 everyone who pledged $200+ will receive a free Laser-Cutter switch blade,
          which has similar capabilities as the Laser-Cutter knife, but intended for self-defense purposes. If we reach $1,000,000 than anyone who pledged $500+ will receive a free Laser-Cutter chainsaw, which cuts through trees like butter.

        <h4 style="margin-left: 42%; margin-top: 3%">Video Effects:</h4>

        <p class="para-main">
          The crowdfunding video that I made is a video on 2 new “future” kitchen knives designed to make cutting food easier with the help of technology.
          The software that I used to create this video was Sony Vegas 13 and Adobe After Effects. Sony Vegas was used to edit the format of the video as well as add music and other sound effects,
          while Adobe After Effects was used to create the special video effects.
        </p>

        <p class="para-main">
          The three different video effects that I created through Adobe After Effects was the laser knife, electricity knife, and some minor video enhancing effects such as sharpening and blurring in certain parts of the video.
          To create the laser knife effect, I followed this guide on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2O4nL7gTLs">YouTube.</a> Creating this effect is very tedious, as you have to manually cut out each frame with the pen tool to match with whatever object you want to add the effect to, in this case it would be the knife.
          After you’ve cut out each frame you copy and paste the same masking effect multiple times and change the feather value on each one to give it a “glowing” effect. After you add a new solid layer on top you are ready to create a new composition with the same video,
          then drag the first composition over the second and change the blending mode to screen so now you will be able to see the glowing effect over the knife. To finish it off you can change the colour correction effect of the first composition to change the colour of the laser effect.
          For the electricity knife I used the lightning effect in After Effects and like the laser knife, manually changed the location of it each frame to make it “follow” the knife. This gives it the appearance that the knife is surrounded by electricity while making it have smooth transitions through each frame.
          For the final effects I did some minor “touch-up” effects in various locations throughout the video, specifically adding sharpening and blurring effects. This gives the video a more “professional” look and adds some nice detail.
        </p>

        <p class="para-main">
          After I had all the effects created through After Effects I imported the result into Sony Vegas to trim it up and add sound effects. First, I cut out some of the unused footage that would have been useless in the final video, then added some blending effects such as fading in and out as well as the credit roll.
          For the sound effects and voice over I used audacity to record and edit and then imported them into Sony Vegas to match with the video. I also created the intro image through photoshop and imported the result into Sony Vegas to incorporate into the intro of the video.
